# Online-Offline-Budget-Tracker

## Project Goal

The goal of this assignment was to add offline functionality to budget tracker app.

## Functionality

The budget tracker allows a user to add expenses and view them in a graph format.  The feature worked on this assignment was being able to add expenses while the app was offline and then having those features auto populate when back online.

This was done by cache-ing information using the service-worker.js.
